                "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."

Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone."

The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that we're finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself. Stress and anxiety are both part of being human, but both can be problems if they last for a long time or have an impact on our well-being or daily life."

Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue.A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression."

I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan.  After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone.

                "Here are some tips on how to fix communication problems when one person has trouble accepting what the other person says:       Talk about it.     The first step is to talk to the other person about your concerns. Explain how their behavior makes you feel and why it's important to you that they listen to you.     Be respectful.     Even if you're feeling frustrated, it's important to be respectful of the other person. Avoid name-calling or personal attacks.     Use I statements.     When you're talking about your feelings, use I statements to help the other person understand how their behavior is affecting you. For example, you could say I feel hurt when you don't listen to me.     Be willing to compromise.     It's unlikely that you'll be able to get the other person to agree with you 100% of the time. Be willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of you.     Seek professional help.     If you're struggling to resolve your communication problems on your own, you may want to consider seeking professional help. A therapist can help you learn how to communicate more effectively and resolve conflict.  In short, the best way to fix communication problems is to talk about them openly and respectfully. Be willing to compromise and seek help if necessary."

                "Sure, here are some tips on how I typically handle criticism or negative feedback:  1.     Listen actively and try to understand the other person's perspective.     .     Don't take the criticism personally.     .     Consider whether the criticism is fair and constructive.    4.     If the criticism is fair, use it as an opportunity to improve.     .     If the criticism is unfair, politely decline to accept it.      I believe that it's important to be able to handle criticism in a healthy way. Criticism can be a valuable tool for growth, but it can also be hurtful if it's not handled properly. By following these tips, I'm able to learn from criticism and use it to become a better person.  Here are some additional tips that I find helpful:       Take some time to cool down before responding.     It's easy to get defensive when you're being criticized, but it's important to take a step back and collect your thoughts before you respond.     Acknowledge the criticism, even if you don't agree with it.     This shows that you're listening and that you're open to feedback.     Ask for clarification if you're not sure what the other person is saying.     This will help you to understand their perspective and to respond in a more thoughtful way.     Thank the person for their feedback.     Even if you don't agree with the criticism, it's still important to be grateful for the person's willingness to share their thoughts with you.  I hope these tips help you to handle criticism in a healthy way."

When we compare ourselves to others, we are often only seeing their highlights, while we are aware of our own flaws. This can make us feel like we are not good enough. It is important to remember that everyone is different, and we should not compare ourselves to others. We should focus on our own strengths and accomplishments, and be proud of who we are. Here are some tips for stopping the comparison game: *     Focus on your own strengths and accomplishments.     What are you good at? What have you achieved? Make a list of your positive qualities and remind yourself of them whenever you start to feel inadequate.       Be kind to yourself.     Everyone makes mistakes. Don't be so hard on yourself when you mess up. Instead, learn from your mistakes and move on.       Compare yourself to your past self, not to others.     How have you grown and improved over time? Focus on your own progress, not on how you measure up to others.       Cut back on social media.     Social media can be a breeding ground for comparison. If you find yourself comparing yourself to others on social media, take a break from it.       Talk to someone you trust.     If you are struggling with feelings of inadequacy, talk to a friend, family member, therapist, or other trusted person. They can offer support and help you to see yourself in a more positive light."
